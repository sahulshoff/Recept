INGREDIENTS
 3 King oyster mushroom stalks
 4 Buns of choice
 Ruby sauerkraut or pickled onion
 3 tbsp vegan mayo
 2 large pickles
INGREDIENTS - STICKY BBQ MARINADE
 1 tsp garlic powder
 4 tbsp tamari sauce
 4 tbsp tomato puree (or ketchup)
 2 tbsp maple syrup
 1 tsp dijon mustard
 4 tbsp dark brown Muscovado sugar
 4 tbsp white wine vinegar/rice or apple
DIRECTIONS
Remove the cap from the mushrooms. Slice the stalk lengthwise into roughly 3 x 2 inch thick slices.

Whisk all the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl, add the mushroom slices to the bowl and coat well in the marinade.

In a large bottomed flat pan, heat 1Tbsp of oil over a high heat, add the mushrooms to the pan in an even layer, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 1-2 minutes per side adding a few tablespoons of water to stop the mushrooms from drying out and becoming chewy.

While the mushrooms are cooking, toast your buns and get your toppings ready.

Toss the cooked mushrooms in a bowl with the marinade, coating them well.

Serve 3 slices of mushroom per serving. Serve on your favourite lightly toasted bun, with some vegan mayo, pickles and we used some red sauerkraut but you could use coleslaw too. Enjoy!
